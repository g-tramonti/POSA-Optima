# POSA-Optima
R script for the Probabilistic One-way Sensitivity Analysis based on the Optima model.

See https://github.com/peterhall001/OPTIMA for the original model.

Use master_base-case.R to run the model. Depending on the CPU of your computer, the POSA might take several minutes to complete.

Please note: the model requires a dataset to run, which is currently not available in the public domain. Please get in touch if you would like to use this.

The code is part of the supporting documentation for:
